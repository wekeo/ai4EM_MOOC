    "[CUMULO](https://github.com/FrontierDevelopmentLab/CUMULO) is a benchmark dataset for training and evaluating global cloud classification models. It merges two satellite products from [NASA's A-train constellation](https://atrain.nasa.gov/): the [Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS)](https://modis.gsfc.nasa.gov/about/) onboard the Aqua satellite and the [2B-CLDCLASS-LIDAR product](http://www.cloudsat.cira.colostate.edu/data-products/2b-cldclass-lidar) derived from the combination of CloudSat Cloud Profiling Radar (CPR) and CALIPSO Cloud‐Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization (CALIOP).\n",

    "MODIS products are hyperspectral images (**swaths**) of size 1354 x 2030 pixels saved at a spatial resolution of 1km by 1km. \n",
    "The MODIS detector measures 36 spectral bands (**channels**) between 620 and 14385 nm. Different _cloud properties_ can then be inferred from these channels (e.g. Cloud Temperature or Clouds Top Height), but no cloud labels are available. \n",
    "\n",
    "* #### 2B-CLDCLASS-LIDAR product\n",
    "2B-CLDCLASS-LIDAR provides _cloud labels_ corresponding to the eight World Meteorological Organization (WMO) genera and other useful vertical information. These annotations are derived considering known properties of the WMO cloud types and thanks to the additional instruments. Nevertheless, they are not provided everywhere, but only on pixel-width (1km x 1km) ‘tracks’ of the satellites, with a revisit period of 16 days (no global coverage at 1km resolution is available even after 16 days).\n",
